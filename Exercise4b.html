Broken all the pieces I've been shaping lately<br>
Focused on the things that didn't make no sense<br>
Guess that growing up was never meant to be easy<br>
Yeah, I got used to doing everything sideways<br>
Didn't really care about how everyone felt<br>
Hiding my emotions down in different ashtrays </i><br>

Oh, but what is lost ain't gone<br>
No, you can't just let go<br>
'Cause it's a part of you that will make you strong<br>
Embrace your flaws</u><br>

<p style=color:green;font-family:Chiller;font-size:15pt><b><i>
I'm not gonna fight back what I've become<br>
Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from<br>
But I wouldn't change if I could restart<br>
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars<br>
I've been going way too hard on myself<br>
Guess that it's the reason that I'm feeling like hell<br>
But I wouldn't change if I could restart<br>
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars</b></i><br>

<p style="text-align:right;font-family:Harrington;color:orange;font-size:14pt;"><i><u>
I went down a road that only got me nowhere<br>
I've seen every corner, every inch of this place<br>
Being all alone it really got me thinking<br>
Maybe overthinking</i></u> <br>
