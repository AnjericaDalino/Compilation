        Several private schools have started their online classes and it seems like students are having a
        tough time coping with the new set up and vented their frustrations on Twitter with the hashtag #AcademicFreeze.
     </p>

    <p style="margin-left:600px; margin-right: 500px;font-family:Tahoma;text-align:justify;">
       Calls for an academic freeze are nothing new as parents and students have earlier expressed their desire to put a halt 
       to this school year to make education more equal for people for all walks of life since not everybody has access to the 
       Internet and can afford to provide each kid with a laptop or tablet.

        However, the main concern now for students is just how difficult online schooling is compared to actual classes. Several students 
        lamented that they are no longer learning, as their focus has shifted to completing assignments on a daily basis.

        but please – more consideration for us students. If (a) teacher (is) having a hard time, well, the students also. We need a break! 
        We are exhausted (from) having lots of modules.”
        <br> <br>
        @abcutie2 said that online classes are so “stressful,” while @simp4dazai_ said they are now “only studying to comply, not to learn.”
        <br> <br>
        “We’re not learning anymore, we’re just like a robot doing tasks and giving the requirements just to move up for next year,” 
        echoed @lovingasunshine.
        <br> <br>
        Even students who love to study are struggling with online schooling.

        “I’m not against education. In fact, I love studying, pero kung ganito ang magiging sistema, hindi lang ang mga estudyante ang nahihirapan 
        (but if this will be the system, not only the students will have a tough time) but also the teachers. It’s not about learning anymore, 
        it’s about passing,” shared @lostloserposts.

        @3plemoneyy tweeted on behalf of his sister, who is overwhelmed by the amount of work the school is demanding from her.
        “Let me share to everyone my younger sister’s story,” he said. “FYI she’s only in 3rd grade but she has a bunch of tasks 
        to do and required to submit it next day. Like? Do you really even think that my sister can go that far?” 
        <br> <br>
        @sageofthegalaxy said they might survive the school year, but they might not have the proper know-how to tackle the next grade. 
        “Please don’t ever blame us in the next semesters about not learning anything from this semester of online requirements. Because all 
        I did were requirements here, requirements there… I’m not learning anything, just feeling the pressure,” he said.

        A lot of students blamed the government and accused the Department of Education (DepEd) for their predicament.
        <br> <br>
        @krzzlrpdvlrs fumed, “I’m sorry but I have to say DepEd and CHED are being inconsiderate and selfish. Where’s the leadership in their decision? 
        They’re just thinking about the future, not minding what it will cost us in the present time.”
        <br> <br>
        @wokinamo added, “Let’s face the fact that we are not fully equipped in this kind of educational setup. Embrace the reality that the 
        government has inefficient plans and those poorest of the poor are greatly affected by this pandemic.”
        <br> <br>
        “Education becomes a privilege, when it should be a RIGHT,” stressed @KianMkrmdm. “That’s why online schooling sucks. That’s why we are for #AcademicFreeze. 
        I AM THANKFUL OF MY PRIVILEGES, but I won’t disregard the fact that those privileges are not meant to be JUST privileges.”
